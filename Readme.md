# How to Use the ASP.NET Core Back-End to Integrate the Document Viewer and Report Designer in JavaScript with React Library

This example consists of two parts:Â 

- A server (back-end)Â ASP.NET Core project that enables [cross-domain requests (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) (Access-Control-Allow-Origin) and implements a custom web report storage.

- Document Viewer and Report Designer front-end client applications created with the [React JavaScript Library](https://reactjs.org/).

Perform the following steps to run this example:

1. Open the back-end project solution (**CS\ServerSide.sln**) in Visual Studio and run the project. 
2. Navigate to the **JS\react-document-viewer** folder that is the client part's root folder. Open the src\App.js file and change the port number in the **host** setting to the back-end application's port.
3. Open the console and run the following command:

    ```npm install```

4. Run the command to compile and start the client part:

    ```npm start```

5. The client application opens the browser at http://localhost:3000/. It displays the **Document Viewer** with the **Products** report.

6. Navigate to the **JS\react-report-designer** folder that is the client part's root folder. Open the src\App.js file and change the port number in the **host** setting to the back-end application's port.

7. Open the console and run the following command:

    ```npm install```

8. Run the command to compile and start the client part:

    ```npm start```

9. The client application opens the browser at http://localhost:3000/. It displays the **Report Designer** with the **Products** report.
